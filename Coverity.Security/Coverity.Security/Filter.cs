    /**
     * Filter is a small set of methods for filtering tainted data that cannot be escaped. These
     * methods may change the semantics of the data if it cannot be determined to be safe, however
     * great care has been taken in the design to ensure that they behave in a way that "makes
     * sense" intuitively
     * <p>
     * These methods fit into the nested escaper framework that the Escape class supports, and
     * should be used as the innermost "escaper" to ensure correctness, e.g.
     * &lt;iframe src="@Cov.AsURL(param.web)"> &lt;/iframe>
     * Ensure that that param.web cannot escape the src attribute, but also ensures that it cannot
     * be a URL that causes XSS.
     * <p>
     * While Coverity's static analysis product references these escaping routines
     * as exemplars and understands their behavior, there is no dependency on
     * Coverity products and these routines are completely standalone. Feel free to
     * use them! Just make sure you use them correctly.
